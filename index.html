 <p><strong>Plot: </strong>Doyle's final novel featuring the beloved sleuth, Sherlock Holmes, brings the detective and his friend to a country manor where they are preceded by either a murder or a suicide. A secretive organization lies culprit and an infiltration of it is in order.</p>	 	

 <p><strong>My opinion: </strong>I had wanted to read this book since "The last adventure" because I thought it  narrated the last duel between Moriarty and Holmes. Sad story: it doesn't. Well, it can be considered a battle between the pair because Sherlock Holmes is trying to stop James Moriarty, but the latter is only mentioned, never shown, and it doesn't meddle with the story so much. I mean, he does the background work, as always.<br>
Because of it, you should at least know who James Moriarty is, before reading the book.<br>
After 4 books and about 23 short stories read (by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle), I still can't decide which of them I prefer.
The stories are amazing, but I can't read too many of them in a row because they get all alike: there is an introduction, a client comes and explains his problem, Sherlock Holmes finds some clues and finally he solves the problem. All this way, with few exceptions. But I like them anyway, it's just the only flaw I find in them. The books have a bigger investigation part (and I love it!) but the case has always his roots in the past (with more importance for "A study in scarlet" and "The valley of fear" than for "The sign of the four") and when Watson writes about the events of the past... it gets a little boring. I just don't know why, but I think it's because I want Sherlock Holmes, John Watson, crime and all this stuff, while the flashback has none of these things. <br>
Anyway, while they have the same amount of flashback, I liked this book much more than "A study in scarlet" because the reader could have guessed the solution. I really like "A study in scarlet" but I think the culprit is impossible to find out. The solution is so bound to the past that — how could Sherlock Holmes know that? In "The valley of fear" you can understand his reasons, and you appreciate his reasonings much more. But the killings in "A study in scarlet" were more interesting and cooler.<br>
Moreover the book has a couple of absolutely stunning plot twists (also in the "boring" flashback part) and you should definitely read it.

<p><strong>Quotes: </strong><br>
“It is, I admit, mere imagination, but how often is imagination the mother of truth?”<br>
“But the quick inference, the subtle trap, the clever forecast of coming events, the triumphant vindication of bold theories — are these not the pride and the justification of our life's work?”
